## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a senior full-stack engineer with 8+ years of experience building and maintaining **production-grade SaaS platforms** used by paying customers.

My work sits at the intersection of backend engineering, system design, and real-world product constraints. I’ve spent most of my career working on **existing systems** — improving reliability, scaling workflows, and fixing the hard problems that only appear after launch.

I value ownership, clarity, and long-term maintainability over short-term wins.

## 🧠 Engineering Philosophy

* **Production First** – Live systems dictate architecture, not slides
* **State > UI** – Business rules belong in the backend
* **Ownership Mindset** – If it breaks, I fix it
* **Incremental Refactoring** – Stability before elegance
* **Clarity Over Cleverness** – Code should explain itself
